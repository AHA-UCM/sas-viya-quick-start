2.	In the Navigation pane on the left, select **Explorer**. 
3.	Expand **Files** > **data** > **quick-start**. If this folder exsists, then the supporting files are loaded in your environment. 

If the files are not loaded, then follow the **Installation** steps.

2.	Unzip the files to your local machine. By default, the files will be in a folder named **sas-viya-quick-start-main**.
3.	In SAS Viya, select the Applications menu in the upper left corner and select **Develop Code and Flows**. SAS Studio launches. 
4.	In the Navigation pane on the left, select the **Explorer** icon. 
5.	Expand **Files**. Navigate to your preferred location for storing the video files. You must have write access.  Right-click on the desired folder and select **New folder**. Name the folder **quick-start**.
